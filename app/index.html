<!--
    normaly you have been writing your javascript inside script tags
    but as you can see above i didnt write any javascript I instead pointed the
    tag to load a file containing my javascript i did this with the src="./src/index.js"
    the "./" meaning "from here" in the directory "src/" use "index.js"

    src stands for source. Thats all i'm going to tell you here
